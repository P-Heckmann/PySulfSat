Welcome to PySCSS- An Open-Source python3 tool for calculating sulfide solubility in magmas. 

This tool is currently in progress, with planned submission to Volcanica in the near future.

We welcome user feedback/requests for new functions to be included. You can either email the lead author (wieserp (at) oregonstate.edu), or post a enhancement request/report of a bug on the Issue page of the github page. https://github.com/PennyWieser/Thermobar/issues

Units
==============================

PySCS performs all calculations in Kelvin for temperature, kbar for Pressure, and returns
the SCSS in ppm.
